# Java Concepts

## SOLID Principle 

- **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP)</br>
_A class should do one and only one job._

- **Open for Extension/Closed for Modification** (Open Close Principle | OCP)</br>
_Software entities should be Open for extension, but closed for modification._

- **Liskov Substitution Principle** (LSP)</br>
_A child class must be able to completely substitute and act-in for itâ€™s base(parent) class._

- **Interface Segregation Principle** (ISP)</br>
_A client should never be forced to implement a function that it does not require. Instead of having bloated interfaces, segregate them based on roles._

- **Dependency Inversion Principle** (DIP)</br>
_Entities must depend on abstractions instead of concretions. Instead of using direct references from a high-level module to a low-level module, use abstractions._

## OOP's Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology of designing a program using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

- **Object** </br>
_Object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures._

- **Class** </br>
_A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)_

- **Inheritance** </br>
_Inheritance is the property of a child/derived/subclass which allows it to inherit the properties(data members) and functionalities(methods) from its parent/base/superclass._

- **Polymorphism** </br>
_Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or an object to take multiple forms. It allows you to define one interface or method and have multiple implementations. There are two types of polymorphism in Java._
</br>1. **Compile Time Polymorphism** </br>
</br>2. **Run Time Polymorphism** </br>
